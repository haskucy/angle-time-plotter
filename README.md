# Angle-to-Time Plotter

This program is designed to plot and find the exact time corresponding to a given angle. The current version is a Jupyter project that contains all the necessary functions and example usage to run.

## Features:
1. **Plotting Clock**: Given a specific time, the program can generate a clock plot to visualize the positions of hour, minute, and second hands.
2. **Exact Time Calculation**: The program can determine the exact time that corresponds to a given angle on the clock.
3. **Multiple Time Calculation**: Additionally, the program can find all the times that correspond to a given angle on the clock.

## Usage:
- The program is currently available as a Jupyter notebook. To use it, you can run the notebook using tools such as Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- For convenient usage, it is recommended to utilize Google Colab, an online Jupyter notebook environment.

## To-Do List:
1. **Create a GUI**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience and provide a user-friendly way to interact with the program.

Please note that the project is actively being developed, and new updates will be added to improve the functionality and user interface. Contributions and feedback are welcome to make this program even more useful and accessible.
